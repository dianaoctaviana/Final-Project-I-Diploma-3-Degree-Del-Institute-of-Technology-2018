Hello, Im Diana, part of PA1-1819-D3TI13, want to share about our Documents that needed for Sitoluama Village Administration System. 
If you want this source or code that we built before, you can ask me or inform me. 

The documents required for this system are Minutes of Meeting (MoM), Term of Reference (ToR), Project Implementation Plan (PiP), Software Requirement Spesification (SRS) and Technical Document (TD).

Enjoy it!
